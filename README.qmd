pip install git+https://github.com/TJhon/dolar-peru
```

## Usage

### Last Track

To use the tool and access the most recent information, follow these steps:

1. Import the `PeruDolar` class from the `PDolar.api` module:

```{python}
from PDolar.api import PeruDolar
```

2. Create an instance of the tracker. You can pass a specific ID if needed, or `None` to use the default configuration:

```{python}
tracker = PeruDolar(id = None)
```

3. Access the information from banks:

```{python}
tracker.bank.head()
```

4. Check the data from exchange houses:

```{python}
tracker.houses.head()
```

5. Retrieve data from SUNAT:

```{python}
tracker.sunat
```

### Dates

The `PDolar` module provides functions to load and retrieve data related to currency exchange rates from different sources, such as exchange houses (`he`) and banks (`bank`). The functions return dictionaries containing the required data, with default keys for exchange houses and banks.

```{python}
from PDolar.load_data.get_data import load_data, last_days_data, load_day_data

from datetime import datetime as dt, timedelta
```

#### Between dates

Load data for a range of dates between

```{python}
today = dt(2024, 8, 19)
day_n = dt(2024, 8, 16)

range_data = load_data(day_n, today)
range_data['bank'].tail()
```

```{python}
range_data['he'].tail() # house exchanges
```

#### Last Data

Retrieve data for the last days number of days.

```{python}
data_last = last_days_data(days=2)
data_last["he"].head()
```

```{python}

data_last["bank"].head()
```

#### Especific Date

Get data for a specific date.

```{python}
data_day = load_day_data(today - timedelta(1))
data_day["he"].head()
```

```{python}

data_day["bank"].head()
```
